# Aroma-Link Integration for Home Assistant

This custom component provides integration with Aroma-Link WiFi diffusers in Home Assistant.

> **Note:** The integration appears in Home Assistant as "Aroma-Link (New)" with the domain `aroma_link_new`

## Features

- Control diffuser power state (on/off)
- Set diffuser work duration
- Set diffuser schedules
- Run diffuser for specific durations
- Automatic device discovery
- Auto-detection of devices in your Aroma-Link account

## Installation

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `aromalink` directory to your Home Assistant `custom_components` directory
   - The directory is typically located at `<config>/custom_components/`
   - If the `custom_components` directory doesn't exist, create it
   
   For example:
   ```bash
   cp -r aromalink <home_assistant_config>/custom_components/
   ```

2. Restart Home Assistant

### Configuration

1. In Home Assistant, go to **Configuration** â†’ **Integrations**
2. Click the **+ ADD INTEGRATION** button
3. Search for "Aroma-Link (New)" and select it
4. Enter your Aroma-Link username and password
5. The integration will automatically discover and add all devices in your account

## Services

The integration provides the following services:

### `aroma_link_new.set_scheduler`
Set the scheduler for the diffuser.

Parameters:
- `work_duration`: Duration in seconds for the diffuser to work (required)
- `week_days`: Days of the week to apply the schedule (optional, defaults to all days)
- `device_id`: The ID of the device to control (optional, required if you have multiple devices)

### `aroma_link_new.run_diffuser`
Run the diffuser for a specific time.

Parameters:
- `work_duration`: Work duration in seconds for the diffuser (required)
- `diffuse_time`: Total time in seconds for the diffuser to run (required)
- `device_id`: The ID of the device to control (optional, required if you have multiple devices)

## Entities

The integration adds the following entities:

- **Switch**: Control the power state of the diffuser
- **Button**: Send immediate commands to the diffuser
- **Number**: Set work duration values

## How It Works

The integration works by:

1. Connecting to the Aroma-Link account using your credentials
2. Automatically discovering all devices in your account
3. Setting up all devices as separate entities in Home Assistant
4. Maintaining a shared authentication session for all devices

### Auto-Discovery Feature

The new auto-discovery feature eliminates the need to manually find your device ID. When setting up:

1. The integration authenticates with the Aroma-Link server
2. It requests a list of all devices registered to your account
3. All devices are automatically added to Home Assistant
4. Each device gets its own set of entities (switch, button, number controls)

### Technical Details

- The integration uses the same API as the official Aroma-Link website
- All communication is done securely over HTTPS
- Session management is handled with cookies and automatic re-login when needed
- The integration checks device status every minute by default

## Troubleshooting

- If you have issues connecting, verify that your Aroma-Link credentials are correct
- Check the Home Assistant logs for debugging information
- Make sure your diffuser is connected to your WiFi network and accessible from the internet
- If automatic device discovery fails, you can still manually specify your device ID

## FAQ

**Q: Can I control multiple diffusers?**  
A: Yes! The integration now automatically discovers and adds all diffusers in your Aroma-Link account. Each diffuser gets its own set of entities in Home Assistant. When using service calls, you can specify which device to control using the `device_id` parameter, or leave it blank to use the first device if you only have one.

**Q: Why is my diffuser showing as offline?**  
A: Make sure your diffuser is connected to WiFi and properly set up in the Aroma-Link app.

**Q: How do I find my device ID?**  
A: You don't need to! The integration automatically discovers your devices and lets you select which one to use from a list.
